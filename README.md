ProjectManager
==============

A simple test program to manage projects. Its main purpose is for me to develop my skills in c#

Objectives:
	- Store a collection of projects with linked file location and changelog.
	- Save and load these collections from a unified file type.
	- Be able to combine files into one larger collection of projects or split the collection of projects into sub topic files.
	- Edit each project and add / remove assosiated files and directories.
	- Possible integration with SQL or alt cloud storage method for portable project management.
	- Allow for multiple people to be editing projects from alternate locations without damaging the work of the other contributor.
	- Perhaps add encryption and password protection to project collections both locally and remotely stored.
	- Perhaps allow different contributors to have permissions for each file or project.
